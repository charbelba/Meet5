Microservices Architecture Components:
1. User Service :
Manages user profiles, registration, authentication, and updates.
Provides APIs for creating, updating, and deleting user profiles.
4. Fraud Detection Service
Monitors user behavior for detecting fraud.
Analyzes activity patterns to identify suspicious actions.
Collaborates with the User Service to mark users as "fraudulent" when needed.

6. API Gateway
Acts as the entry point for external clients.
Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
Manages authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformations

8. Data Storage
Microservices manage their own data storage (relational, NoSQL, etc.).
Choice between database-per-service or shared-database models based on requirements.

10. Event Broker
Utilizes a message broker like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Microservices publish events related to activities and updates.
Subscribed services react to events for enhanced responsiveness.

12. Load Balancers and Scaling
Implements load balancers for even request distribution.
Enables independent scaling of microservices based on demand.

14. Service Discovery
Incorporates tools like Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes' service discovery.
Facilitates service registration and discovery across the architecture.

16. Fault Tolerance and Monitoring
Implements resilience with circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts.
Employs monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for real-time insights.

18. Containerization and Orchestration
Deploys microservices using Docker containers for consistency.
Orchestrates containers with Kubernetes for automated management and scaling.

20. Security
Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Ensures secure communication via HTTPS and utilizes JWT tokens.
Regularly conducts security audits and vulnerability assessments.
